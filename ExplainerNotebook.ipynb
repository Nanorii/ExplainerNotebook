        "* Monthly patterns: There are fewer alarms over the summer period (May, June, July). A reason for this pattern could the reducing of workforce in the vacation time. There are most water rescues in the summer period, with most calls in May. It could be due to the change of the weather and the starting summer time. There are most gas leak calls in the winter period and least calls in the summer. Gas is used more in the winter period, because of the colder weather. There are more calls about outside fire in the summer than in the winter, but there are the most in July and January. It make sense that there are more outside fires in summer period. The peak in January could be a consequence of new years eve. There are least electrical hazard calls in late summer (August and September), and most calls in the winter period. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Yearly patterns: As previouly mentioned, for some of the call types the number of calls increase over the years. This could be due to the increasing population in San Francisco. The number of people in San Francisco has grown by around 10 % over the past ten years. But for other call types the number of calls have decreased over the years, e.g. structure fire, odor and vehicle fire. This could be due to the fact that cars are less flammable today than previously. \n",

It seems like water rescue only occurs in neighborhoods located next to the sea, e.g. Bayview Hunters Point, North Beach, Marina and South Beach. It also seems like the call type elevator/escalator rescue is most common in some neighborhoods, where there is many calls of this type, and it seems like there is almost none in other neighborhoods. When we investigated this we discovered that the neighborhoods with most of this call type has many inhabitants and many towers, where the neighborhoods with least of the call type are parks and neighborhoods with fewer inhabitants. \n",

This is also called author-driven, where we have a linear ordering of scenes and heavy messaging.
